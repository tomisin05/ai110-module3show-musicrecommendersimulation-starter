# 🎵 Music Recommender Simulation

## Project Summary

VibeCheck 1.0 is a content-based music recommender that scores every song in a 20-song catalog against a user's taste profile and returns the top 5 matches with plain-language explanations. Each song is scored on genre match, mood match, energy proximity, and an optional acoustic preference bonus. The system is designed for classroom exploration — not production use — and demonstrates how simple weighted rules can produce surprisingly intuitive (and sometimes surprising) recommendations.

## How The System Works

### Real-World Context

Platforms like Spotify use two main approaches: **collaborative filtering** (recommending songs that users with similar listening histories enjoyed) and **content-based filtering** (recommending songs whose audio features match what you already like). VibeCheck 1.0 is purely content-based — it never looks at what other users do.

### Features Used

Each `Song` in the catalog has:

- `genre` — categorical (pop, rock, lofi, edm, etc.)
- `mood` — categorical (happy, chill, intense, sad, etc.)
- `energy` — float 0.0–1.0 (how energetic the track feels)
- `acousticness` — float 0.0–1.0 (how acoustic vs. electronic)
- `tempo_bpm`, `valence`, `danceability` — present in the CSV but not used in scoring (future work)

Each `UserProfile` stores:

- `favorite_genre`, `favorite_mood` — categorical preferences
- `target_energy` — the energy level the user wants
- `likes_acoustic` — boolean flag for acoustic preference

### Algorithm

```
score = 0

if song.genre == user.favorite_genre  →  +2.0  (genre match)
if song.mood  == user.favorite_mood   →  +1.0  (mood match)
energy_score = 1.0 - |song.energy - user.target_energy|  →  +0.0 to +1.0
if user.likes_acoustic and song.acousticness >= 0.7  →  +0.5  (acoustic bonus)
```

Songs are then sorted by score descending and the top `k` are returned.

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate      # Mac or Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

   ```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

### Running Tests

Run the starter tests with:

```bash
pytest
```

You can add more tests in `tests/test_recommender.py`.

## Experiments You Tried

Use this section to document the experiments you ran. For example:

- What happened when you changed the weight on genre from 2.0 to 0.5
- What happened when you added tempo or valence to the score
- How did your system behave for different types of users

---

## Limitations and Risks

Summarize some limitations of your recommender.

Examples:

- It only works on a tiny catalog
- It does not understand lyrics or language
- It might over favor one genre or mood

You will go deeper on this in your model card.

---

## Reflection

Read and complete `model_card.md`:

[**Model Card**](model_card.md)

Write 1 to 2 paragraphs here about what you learned:

- about how recommenders turn data into predictions
- about where bias or unfairness could show up in systems like this

---

## 7. `model_card_template.md`

Combines reflection and model card framing from the Module 3 guidance. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

```markdown
# 🎧 Model Card - Music Recommender Simulation

## 1. Model Name

Give your recommender a name, for example:

> VibeFinder 1.0

---

## 2. Intended Use

- What is this system trying to do
- Who is it for

Example:

> This model suggests 3 to 5 songs from a small catalog based on a user's preferred genre, mood, and energy level. It is for classroom exploration only, not for real users.

---

## 3. How It Works (Short Explanation)

Describe your scoring logic in plain language.

- What features of each song does it consider
- What information about the user does it use
- How does it turn those into a number

Try to avoid code in this section, treat it like an explanation to a non programmer.

---

## 4. Data

Describe your dataset.

- How many songs are in `data/songs.csv`
- Did you add or remove any songs
- What kinds of genres or moods are represented
- Whose taste does this data mostly reflect

---

## 5. Strengths

Where does your recommender work well

You can think about:

- Situations where the top results "felt right"
- Particular user profiles it served well
- Simplicity or transparency benefits

---

## 6. Limitations and Bias

Where does your recommender struggle

Some prompts:

- Does it ignore some genres or moods
- Does it treat all users as if they have the same taste shape
- Is it biased toward high energy or one genre by default
- How could this be unfair if used in a real product

---

## 7. Evaluation

How did you check your system

Examples:

- You tried multiple user profiles and wrote down whether the results matched your expectations
- You compared your simulation to what a real app like Spotify or YouTube tends to recommend
- You wrote tests for your scoring logic

You do not need a numeric metric, but if you used one, explain what it measures.

---

## 8. Future Work

If you had more time, how would you improve this recommender

Examples:

- Add support for multiple users and "group vibe" recommendations
- Balance diversity of songs instead of always picking the closest match
- Use more features, like tempo ranges or lyric themes

---

## 9. Personal Reflection

A few sentences about what you learned:

- What surprised you about how your system behaved
- How did building this change how you think about real music recommenders
- Where do you think human judgment still matters, even if the model seems "smart"
```
